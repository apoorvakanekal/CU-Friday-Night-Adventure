# CU-Friday-Night-Adventure
This is a game that leads the user through choices a student at CU Boulder makes on a Friday night. This game was based on the Choose your Own Adventure books. 
This repository includes all the images and the py file needed to play the game.
My group (Vikki Wong, Danielle Sinko, and Caroline Smolky) and I created this game as a fun way for incoming freshman to see what life is like going to school here. 
The code utilizes object oriented programming and several if statements to guide the user depending on what side of the screen they click.
